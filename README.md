### Problem 1. 
The problem of n ministers or n queens tries to arrange n ministers on the n * n chessboard so that no two ministers threaten each other vertically, horizontally or diagonally. For this exercise, you need to develop a genetic algorithm that can find, for n inputs, the location of ministers such that there are no threats. Provide a summary of how it works and explain how your algorithm works. Mention the selection methods for mutation, cross over, selection and the reason for choosing them. Your code should be able to find the answer for n = 100. Note that you should implement it with Python and in Jupyter notebook or with C++.
